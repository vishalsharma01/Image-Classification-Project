# Capstone Project:

Classifing Sports Images using Convolutional Neural Networks

For this project I created my very own dataset of sports images by scraping images off of Google. Using those images I than created a model to classify those images, across 5 different classes (Baseball, Basketball, Football, Hockey, and Soccer) and predict which sport was being played in an image.

The final model was than taken and turned into a web app which has been hosted on Heroku for others to try.
